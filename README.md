# Microsoft Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting Microsoft (MSFT) stock prices using machine learning techniques. Historical stock market data is analyzed to build predictive models that forecast future stock prices.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical stock price data for Microsoft, which can be sourced from:
- Yahoo Finance
- Alpha Vantage
- Quandl
- Other financial data providers

## Model Architecture
This project utilizes various machine learning models for stock price prediction, such as:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**

## Installation and Dependencies
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib yfinance
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Load historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
2. Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and scaling features.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train different machine learning models to predict future stock prices.
5. Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and other metrics.
6. Visualize the actual vs. predicted stock prices.

## Usage
- Run the stock prediction script:
```bash
python stock_prediction.py --ticker MSFT --days 30
```

## Results
The model predicts future stock prices based on historical trends. Evaluation metrics include:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared score

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate sentiment analysis of financial news
- Use ensemble learning techniques for better predictions
- Implement real-time stock price forecasting
